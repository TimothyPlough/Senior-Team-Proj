# Senior-Team-Proj
Team project that I will be making throughout senior semesters for a senior project.
I will be a coder for the most part working with the team to keep the project on path with both its scope and trajectory.
However, if specific circumstances come into play I may also be coder and project lead.
This will be a personal repository in which I will keep the work and highlight Specifically what belongs to me and what belongs to the team.
